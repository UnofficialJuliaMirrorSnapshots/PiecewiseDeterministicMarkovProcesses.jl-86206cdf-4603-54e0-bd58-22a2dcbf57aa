This function performs a simulation using the rejection method.
It takes the following arguments:

- **n_max**: an `Int64` representing the maximum number of jumps to be computed.
- **xc0** : a `Vector` of `Float64`, representing the initial states of the continuous variable.
- **xd0** : a `Vector` of `Int64`, representing the initial states of the discrete variable.
- **F** : a `Function` or a callable type, which itself takes five arguments to represent the vector field; xdot a `Vector` of `Float64` representing the vector field associated to the continuous variable, xc `Vector` of `Float64` representing the current state of the continuous variable, xd `Vector` of `Int64` representing the current state of the discrete variable, t a `Float64` representing the current time and parms, a `Vector` of `Float64` representing the parameters of the system.
- **R!** : a `Function` or a callable type, which itself takes five arguments to represent the rate functions associated to the jumps;xc `Vector` of `Float64` representing the current state of the continuous variable, xd `Vector` of `Int64` representing the current state of the discrete variable, t a `Float64` representing the current time, parms a `Vector` of `Float64` representing the parameters of the system and sum_rate a `Bool` being a flag asking to return a `Float64` if true and a `Vector` otherwise. The returned vector has components. If sum_rate is `False`, one must return rate_vector, bound_ where bound_ is a bound on the total rate vector. In the case sum_rate is `True`, one must return total_rate,bound_ where total_rate is a `Float64` that is the sum of the rates. `R!(rate,xc,xd,t,parms,sum_rate)` returns `Float64,Float64`. In case `sum_rate = true`, you are not allowed to modify the first argument e.g. `rate`
- **Delta** : a `Function` or a callable type, which itself takes five arguments to apply the jump to the continuous variable;xc `Vector` of `Float64` representing the current state of the continuous variable, xd `Vector` of `Int64` representing the current state of the discrete variable, t a `Float64` representing the current time, parms a `Vector` of `Float64` representing the parameters of the system and ind_rec an `Int64` representing the index of the discrete jump.
- **nu** : a `Matrix` of `Int64`, representing the transitions of the system, organised by row.
- **parms** : data for the parameters of the system.
- **tf** : the final simulation time (`Float64`)
- **verbose** : a `Bool` for printing verbose.
- **ode**: ode time stepper :cvode or :lsoda
