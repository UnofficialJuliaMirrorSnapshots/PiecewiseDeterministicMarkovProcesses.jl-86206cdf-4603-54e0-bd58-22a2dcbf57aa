# PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcesses.jl 


PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcesses.jl is a Julia package that allows simulation of *Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes* (PDMP); these encompass hybrid systems and jump processes, comprised of continuous and discrete components, as well as processes with time-varying rates. The aim of the package is to provide methods for the simulation of these processes that are "exact" up to the ODE integrator.

We briefly recall facts about a simple class of PDMPs. They are described by a couple $(x_c, x_d)$ where $x_c$ is solution of the differential equation $\frac{dx_c(t)}{dt} = F(x_c(t),x_d(t),t)$. The second component $x_d$ is a piecewise constant array with type `Int64`. The jumps occur at rates $R(x_c(t),x_d(t),t)$. At each jump, $x_d$ or $x_c$ can be affected.

We provide several methods for the simulation:

- a relatively recent trick, called **CHV**, explained in [paper-2015](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06873) which allows to implement the **True Jump Method** without the need to use event detection schemes for the ODE integrator. These event detections can be quite unstable as explained in [paper-2015](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06873) and CHV provide a solution to this problem.
- **rejection methods** for which the user is asked to provide a bound on the **total** reaction rate. These last methods are the most "exact" but not the fastest if the reaction rate bound is not tight. In case the flow is known **analytically**, a method is also provided.


These methods require solving stiff ODEs (for CHV) in an efficient manner. [```Sundials.jl```](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Sundials.jl) and [```LSODA.jl```](https://github.com/rveltz/LSODA.jl) are great, but other solvers can also be considered (see [stiff ode solvers](http://lh3lh3.users.sourceforge.net/solveode.shtml) and also the [solvers](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/solvers/ode_solve.html) from [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl)). Hence, the current package allows the use of all solvers in `DifferentialEquations.jl` thereby giving access to a wide range of solvers. In particular, we can test different solvers to see how precise they are. Here is an example from `examples/pdmpStiff.jl` for which an analytical expression is available which allows computation of the errors

```

!!! note "ODE Solvers"
    A lot of [care](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/help-reduce-large-gc-time/17215) have been taken to be sure that the algorithms do not allocate and hence are fast. This is based on an iterator interface of `DifferentialEquations`. If you chose `save_positions = (false, false)`, the allocations should be independent from the requested jump number. However, the iterator solution is not yet available for `LSODA` in `DifferentialEquations`. Hence, you can pass `ode = :lsoda` to access an old version of the algorithm (which allocates), or any other solver like `ode = Tsit5()` to access the **new** solver.



## Installation

To install this package, run the command 

```julia
add PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcesses
```

## Basic example with CHV method

**A strong requirement for the CHV method is that the total rate (*i.e.* sum(rate)) must be positive. This can be easily achieved by adding a dummy Poisson process with very low intensity (see next section).**

See also the [examples directory](https://github.com/rveltz/PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcesses.jl/tree/master/examples) for more involved examples. 

A simple example of jump process is given below. More precisely, we look at the following process of switching dynamics where $$X(t) = (x_c(t), x_d(t)) \in\mathbb R\times\lbrace-1,1\rbrace.$$ In between jumps, $x_c$ evolves according to $$\dot x_c(t) = x_d(t)x_c(t).$$  

We first need to load the library.  

```julia
using PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcesses
```
We then define a function that encodes the dynamics in between jumps. We need to provide the vector field of the ODE. Hence, we need to define a function that, given continuous state $x_c$ and discrete state $x_d$ at time $t$, returns the vector field. In addition some parameters can be passed with the variable `parms`.

```julia  
function F_tcp!(xcdot, xc, xd, t, parms)
  # vector field used for the continuous variable
  xcdot[1] = xd[1]*xc[1]
end 
```

Let's consider a stochastic process with following transitions:

| Transition | Rate | Reaction number | Jump |
|---|---|---| ---|
|$x_d\to x_d-2$ if $x_d>0$ | 1 | 1 | [-2] |
|$x_d\to x_d+2$ if $x_d<0$ | 1 | 2 | [2] |

We implement these jumps using a 2x1 matrix `nu` of Integers, such that the jumps on each discrete component `xd` are given by `nu * xd`. Hence, we have `nu = reshape([[2];[-2]],2,1)`.	

!!! note "Implementing jumps"
    There are two ways to implement jumps. The first one is to provide a transition matrix `nu` but this will only implement jumps on the discrete variable `xd` and leaves `xc` unaffected. The more general way is to implement a function `Delta!(xc, xd, t::Float64, parms, ind_reaction::Int64)` in which you write the jump. See `examples/pdmp_example_eva.jl` for an example.


	
	
The rates of these reactions are encoded in the following function.


```julia
function R_tcp!(rate, xc, xd, t, parms, sum_rate::Bool)
  # transition rates function for each transition
  # in this case,  the transitions are xd->xd+2 or xd->xd-2
  # sum_rate is a boolean which tells R_tcp if it needs to return the total reaction rates, this may 
  # i.e. the sum of the rates or the vector of the rates
  if sum_rate == false
      if xd[1] > 0
          rate[1] = 0.
          rate[2] = 1.
      else
      	  rate[1] = 1.
          rate[2] = 0.
      end
      #we return 0. because nothing is supposed to be returned
      return 0.
  else
  	# we return sum(rate) without altering rate as we are asked to do
    return 1.
  end
end

# initial conditions for the continuous/discrete variables
xc0 = vec([0.05])
xd0 = vec([1])

# matrix of jumps for the discrete variables, analogous to chemical reactions
nu = reshape([[2];[-2]],2,1)


# parameters
parms = [0.]
tf = 25.

# compile the program:
dummy =  PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcesses.pdmp!(xc0,xd0,F_tcp!,R_tcp!,nu,parms,0.0,tf,n_jumps=1)

# compute a trajectory, in this case 100 jumps
srand(123)
result =  @time PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcesses.pdmp!(xc0,xd0,F_tcp!,R_tcp!,nu,parms,0.0,tf,n_jumps=100)

# plotting
using Plots
Plots.plot(result.time, result.xd[1,:],line=:step,title = string("#Jumps = ",length(result.time)),label="Xd")
Plots.plot(result.time, result.xc',title = string("#Jumps = ",length(result.time)),label="Xc")
```

This produces the following graph:

## Adding more sampling points in between jumps
The current interface "only" returns the jump times. On may want to resolve the trajectory in between jumps. For example, in the previous example, in between two jumps, the trajectory should be exponential and not linear as shown. 

A simple trick to do this is to add a Poisson process to the reactions set with a given sampling rate. We have to modify `nu, xcd0` and `R_tcp!` for this. The set of reactions is now the following

| Transition | Rate | Jump |
|---|---|---| 
|$x_d[1]\to x_d[1]-2$ if $x_d[1]>0$ | 1 | [-2,0] |
|$x_d[1]\to x_d[1]+2$ if $x_d[1]<0$ | 1 | [2,0] |
|$x_d[2]\to x_d[2]+1$ | rate_save | [0,1] |

Hence, we implement these jumps with the following matrix: `nu2 = [[2 0];[-2 0];[0 1]]`.
	


```julia
nu2 = [[2 0];[-2 0];[0 1]]
# the last component is the Poisson process used for plotting purposes
xd0 = vec([1, 0])

function R_tcp2!(rate, xc, xd, t, parms, sum_rate::Bool)
  # transition rates function for each transition
  # in this case,  the transitions are xd->xd+2 or xd->xd-2
  # sum_rate is a boolean which tells R_tcp if it needs to return the total reaction rates, this may 
  # i.e. the sum of the rates or the vector of the rates
  rate_save = 10. #sampling rate in between true jumps
  if sum_rate == false
      if xd[1] > 0
          rate[1] = 0.
          rate[2] = 1.
          rate[3] = rate_save #Poisson process used as sampling process
      else
          rate[1] = 1.
          rate[2] = 0.
          rate[3] = rate_save #Poisson process used as sampling process
      end
      #we return 0. because nothing is supposed to be returned
      return 0.
  else
    # we see that we effectively return sum(rate) without altering rate because it is not asked to do so
    return 1. + rate_save
  end
end

srand(123)  
result2 =  @time PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcesses.pdmp!(xc0,xd0,F_tcp!,R_tcp2!,nu2,parms,0.0,tf,n_jumps=10000)
Plots.plot(result2.time, result2.xc',title = string("#Jumps = ",length(result2.time)),label="Xc2")
```

This gives the following result:

## Basic example with the rejection method
The previous method is useful when the total rate function varies a lot. In the case where the total rate is mostly constant in between jumps, the **rejection method** is more appropriate. 

The **rejection method** assumes some a priori knowledge of the process one wants to simulate. In particular, the user must be able to provide a bound on the total rate. More precisely, the user must provide a constant bound in between the jumps. To use this method, one needs to return `sum(rate), bound_rejection` in the above function `R_tcp!`. Note that this means that in between jumps, one has:


`sum(rate)(t) <= bound_rejection `

```julia
nu2 = [[2 0];[-2 0];[0 1]]
# the second component is the Poisson process
xd0 = vec([1, 0])

function R_tcp2!(rate, xc, xd, t, parms, sum_rate::Bool)
  # transition rates function for each transition
  # in this case,  the transitions are xd->xd+2 or xd->xd-2
  # sum_rate is a boolean which tells R_tcp if it needs to return the total reaction rates, this may 
  # i.e. the sum of the rates or the vector of the rates
  rate_save       = 10.           # sampling rate in between true jumps
  bound_rejection = 1.+rate_save  # bound on the total rate, here 0 + 1 + rate_save
  if sum_rate == false
      if xd[1] > 0
          rate[1] = 0.
          rate[2] = 1.
          rate[3] = rate_save #Poisson process used as sampling process
      else
          rate[1] = 1.
          rate[2] = 0.
          rate[3] = rate_save #Poisson process used as sampling process
      end
      #we return 0. because nothing is supposed to be returned
      return 0., bound_rejection
  else
    # we see that we effectively return sum(rate) without altering rate because it is not asked to do so
    return 1. + rate_save, bound_rejection
  end
end
```

We can now simulate this process as follows

```julia
srand(123)
result3 =  @time PiecewiseDeterministicMarkovProcesses.pdmp!(xc0,xd0,F_tcp!,R_tcp2!,nu2,parms,0.0,tf,n_jumps=10000,algo=:rejection)
Plots.plot(result3.time, result3.xc',title = string("#Jumps = ",length(result3.time)),label="rejection")
```

## How to chose a simulation method?

The choice of the method CHV vs Rejection only depends on how much you know about the system. 

More precisely, if the total rate function does not vary much in between jumps, use the rejection method. For example, if the rate is $R(x_c(t)) = 1+0.1\cos(t)$,  then $1+0.1$ will provide a tight bound to use for the rejection method and almost no (fictitious) jumps will be rejected. 

In all other cases, one should try the CHV method where no a priori knowledge of the rate function is needed.
